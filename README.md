 <Coder Break Cafe>: 
 
 Description:
 This Application is the beta version of a coder wellness/break app, emulating the experience of a trip to a cafe. Coding is fun, but can be
 hard sometimes. Even the best coder needs a mental break sometimes, but deadlines can make it hard to get out and go to your favorite cafe to refresh
 and get a mental break. This app is supposed to help give coders that sometimes necessary mental time-out without having to leave their home.  
 Pulling from the Tasty API, this app offers up drink recipes, both caffeine based, and something a little more 21 and up. After choosing their drink, 
 the user can opt to scroll down and recieve a serotonin hit by choosing between receiving random cat and/or dog picks, courtesy of the cats API. 
 
 Technologies Used:  
 JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery

 Getting Started: 
 To navigate the app, the user can either utilize the navigation bar links at the top of the application. Or they can scroll through the the site manually.
 Once the user gets to the drink bar, they can type in what kind of drink they want, and get a recipe. After that the user can then click through random cute dog and/or cat pictures on the next card.
 
 
 Future Enhancements: 
 Future development for this app includes a sign-in account for individual users, so they can track and store their favorite drinks, and animal pictures
 so as to personalize their repeat experiences better. More comprhensive API can be used to really narrow down the type of drink a user could want. A timer will be added to set a specific amount of time the use wants to be on their break. An API with quotes will be added along with
 a current tech news API. I would like to add a sound cloud widget from the soundcloud API, to play lofi playlists while the user visits the app.
